                <p>
                    Sometimes, I don't know where this dirty road is taking me<br/>
                    Sometimes, I don't even know the reason why<br/>
                    But I guess I keep a-gamblin', lots of booze, and lots of ramblin'<br/>
                    Well, it's easier than just a-waitin' around to die<br/>
                    <br/>
                    At one time, friends, I had a ma, I even had a pa<br/>
                    Well he beat her with a belt once 'cause she cried<br/>
                    She told him to take care of me, headed down to Tennessee<br/>
                    Well, it's easier than just a-waitin' around to die<br/>
                    <br/>
                    I came of age and I found a girl in a Tuscaloosa bar<br/>
                    Ah, she cleaned me out and hit it on the sly<br/>
                    Well, I tried to kill the pain, I bought some wine and hopped a train<br/>
                    It seemed easier than just a-waitin' around to die<br/>
                    <br/>
                    Then, a friend said he knew where some easy money was<br/>
                    We robbed a man, and, brother, did we fly<br/>
                    But the posse caught up with me and drug me back to Muskogee<br/>
                    And it's two long years a-waitin' around to die<br/>
                    <br/>
                    Ah, but now, I'm out of prison, I got me a friend at last<br/>
                    He don't drink or steal or cheat or lie<br/>
                    Ah his name is Codeine, he's the nicest thing I've seen<br/>
                    Well, together, we're gonna wait around and die<br/>
                    Yeah, together, we're gonna wait around and die<br/>
